## Description
The Productivity Planner provides users with the tools they need to plan and achieve their goals, while also providing an option to view and support others in accomplishing tasks. This planner prevents users from having to utilize multiple applications to plan out their days ahead. Now, all it takes is one application to put you on the path to success.

The Productivity Planner provides users with the option to list their goals, plan their days with an hourly and daily calendar, track their progress, take notes, and view and share their progress with other users in their community. 

## Usage
As a user:
I want to be able to set goals and track them via a calendar, so that I can keep track of my goals and progress
